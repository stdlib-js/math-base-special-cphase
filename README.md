    About stdlib...
  </summary>
  <p>We believe in a future in which the web is a preferred environment for numerical computation. To help realize this future, we've built stdlib. stdlib is a standard library, with an emphasis on numerical and scientific computation, written in JavaScript (and C) for execution in browsers and in Node.js.</p>
  <p>The library is fully decomposable, being architected in such a way that you can swap out and mix and match APIs and functionality to cater to your exact preferences and use cases.</p>
  <p>When you use stdlib, you can be absolutely certain that you are using the most thorough, rigorous, well-written, studied, documented, tested, measured, and high-quality code out there.</p>
  <p>To join us in bringing numerical computing to the web, get started by checking us out on <a href="https://github.com/stdlib-js/stdlib">GitHub</a>, and please consider <a href="https://opencollective.com/stdlib">financially supporting stdlib</a>. We greatly appreciate your continued support!</p>

> Compute the [argument][complex-number-argument] of a double-precision complex floating-point number in radians.

<section class="intro">

The [argument][complex-number-argument] of a complex number, also known as the **phase**, is the angle of the radius extending from the origin to the complex number plotted in the complex plane and the positive real axis.

</section>

<!-- /.intro -->



<section class="usage">

## Usage

```javascript
import cphase from 'https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/stdlib-js/math-base-special-cphase@v0.2.1-esm/index.mjs';
```

#### cphase( z )

Computes the [argument][complex-number-argument] of a double-precision complex floating-point number.

```javascript
import Complex128 from 'https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/stdlib-js/complex-float64@esm/index.mjs';

var phi = cphase( new Complex128( 5.0, 3.0 ) );
// returns ~0.5404
```
