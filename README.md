    About stdlib...
  </summary>
  <p>We believe in a future in which the web is a preferred environment for numerical computation. To help realize this future, we've built stdlib. stdlib is a standard library, with an emphasis on numerical and scientific computation, written in JavaScript (and C) for execution in browsers and in Node.js.</p>
  <p>The library is fully decomposable, being architected in such a way that you can swap out and mix and match APIs and functionality to cater to your exact preferences and use cases.</p>
  <p>When you use stdlib, you can be absolutely certain that you are using the most thorough, rigorous, well-written, studied, documented, tested, measured, and high-quality code out there.</p>
  <p>To join us in bringing numerical computing to the web, get started by checking us out on <a href="https://github.com/stdlib-js/stdlib">GitHub</a>, and please consider <a href="https://opencollective.com/stdlib">financially supporting stdlib</a>. We greatly appreciate your continued support!</p>

> Compute the [argument][complex-number-argument] of a double-precision complex floating-point number in radians.

<section class="intro">

The [argument][complex-number-argument] of a complex number, also known as the **phase**, is the angle of the radius extending from the origin to the complex number plotted in the complex plane and the positive real axis.

</section>

<!-- /.intro -->

<section class="installation">

## Installation

```bash
npm install @stdlib/math-base-special-cphase
```

Alternatively,

-   To load the package in a website via a `script` tag without installation and bundlers, use the [ES Module][es-module] available on the [`esm`][esm-url] branch (see [README][esm-readme]).
-   If you are using Deno, visit the [`deno`][deno-url] branch (see [README][deno-readme] for usage intructions).
-   For use in Observable, or in browser/node environments, use the [Universal Module Definition (UMD)][umd] build available on the [`umd`][umd-url] branch (see [README][umd-readme]).

The [branches.md][branches-url] file summarizes the available branches and displays a diagram illustrating their relationships.

To view installation and usage instructions specific to each branch build, be sure to explicitly navigate to the respective README files on each branch, as linked to above.

</section>

<section class="usage">

## Usage

```javascript
var cphase = require( '@stdlib/math-base-special-cphase' );
```

#### cphase( z )

Computes the [argument][complex-number-argument] of a double-precision complex floating-point number.

```javascript
var Complex128 = require( '@stdlib/complex-float64-ctor' );

var phi = cphase( new Complex128( 5.0, 3.0 ) );
// returns ~0.5404
```

</section>

<!-- /.usage -->

<section class="examples">

## Examples

<!-- eslint no-undef: "error" -->

```javascript
var Complex128 = require( '@stdlib/complex-float64-ctor' );
var uniform = require( '@stdlib/random-base-uniform' );
var cphase = require( '@stdlib/math-base-special-cphase' );

var z;
var i;

for ( i = 0; i < 100; i++ ) {
    z = new Complex128( uniform( -500.0, 500.0 ), uniform( -500.0, 500.0 ) );
    console.log( 'arg(%s) = %d', z.toString(), cphase( z ) );
}

### Usage

```c
#include "stdlib/math/base/special/cphase.h"
```

#### stdlib_base_cphase( z )

Computes the [argument][complex-number-argument] of a double-precision complex floating-point number.

```c
#include "stdlib/complex/float64/ctor.h"
#include "stdlib/complex/float64/real.h"
#include "stdlib/complex/float64/imag.h"

stdlib_complex128_t z = stdlib_complex128( 5.0, 3.0 );
double out = stdlib_base_cphase( z );
// returns ~0.5404
```

The function accepts the following arguments:

-   **z**: `[in] stdlib_complex128_t` input value.

```c
double stdlib_base_cphase( const stdlib_complex128_t z );
```
